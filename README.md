# Heartbeat Vulnerability Tester

## Overview
This project provides a Python script designed to test servers for vulnerabilities to a specific type of Heartbeat vulnerability. It sends malformed heartbeat requests to assess whether a server is vulnerable by checking if it returns more data than it should, indicating a potential vulnerability.

## Features

- **Malformed Heartbeat Request:** Constructs and sends a malformed heartbeat request to test server vulnerability.
- **Payload Extraction:** Processes server response to identify sensitive information leakage.
- **Duplicate Filtering:** Prevents duplicate entries in output by maintaining a record of previously identified vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Testing:** Supports continuous testing with adjustable intervals between tests.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a command-line interface for specifying target host, port, and an optional stream URL for detailed testing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Familiarity with command-line operations and network security

### Running the Script
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Execute the script with Python: `python <script_name.py>`
4. Enter the target host and port, and optionally a stream URL when prompted.

### Input Format
- Host and port should be in the format `host:port`, e.g., `188.241.219.18:25463`.
- Enter the stream URL when prompted for detailed testing.

### Interpreting Results
- The script outputs testing progress in real-time, indicating potential vulnerabilities.
- Detected vulnerabilities and extracted data are saved to a file named `<host>_<port>.txt`.

## Legality and Ethical Use

- **Intended Use:** For security professionals testing systems with authorization.
- **Compliance:** Users must comply with all applicable laws.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Use responsibly for enhancing security, not for exploitation.
